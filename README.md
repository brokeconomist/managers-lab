## Managers’ Lab

**Managers’ Lab** is a decision-testing environment for business and financial analysis.

It is designed to help managers, analysts, and founders understand **what must be true** for a decision to work — not just whether the numbers look good.

This is not a dashboard.
This is not reporting software.

Managers’ Lab focuses on:

* break-even and survival analysis
* pricing and margin sensitivity
* customer lifetime value (CLV)
* cash flow and working capital dynamics
* cost, volume, and timing trade-offs

The goal is not optimization or prediction, but **clarity**:
to expose breakpoints, hidden assumptions, and structural fragility before decisions are tested by reality.

### Core Philosophy

Small decisions are never small.
They quietly change the structure a business must operate within.

Managers’ Lab is built to make those structural shifts visible.

### Status

This project is an ongoing experimental lab.
Tools are added, refined, or redesigned as models evolve.
