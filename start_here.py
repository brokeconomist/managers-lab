Every business decision — no matter how small it seems — has a ripple effect.  
Even tiny price changes, investment choices, or marketing adjustments can shift your break-even point, affect your cash flow, and change your customer lifetime value (CLV).

## 🔍 Key Insight

Most companies focus only on the immediate impact of a decision.  
**Small decisions accumulate** and influence your business long-term performance. Understanding their effect early is what separates reactive management from proactive strategy.

---

## 📊 How this applies to your tools:

- **Break-Even Calculators:** See exactly how minor cost or price changes shift your survival threshold.  
- **CLV Analysis:** Understand how small adjustments in retention or acquisition cost amplify over time.  
- **Credit & Supplier Tools:** Even small changes in payment terms affect your cash cycle and working capital.  

---

## 🚀 Quick Takeaways

1. **Think Beyond Today:** Every €1 you invest or save now compounds across months and years.  
2. **Measure Before You Move:** Use your tools to simulate small changes before implementing them.  
3. **Decisions Are Not Isolated:** A small shift in one area (price, cost, marketing) can affect multiple KPIs.
