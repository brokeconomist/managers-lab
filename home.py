        Welcome to Managers’ Lab — an interactive environment for financial analysis, decision testing, and business modeling.

        This is not a dashboard.
        This is not a reporting or forecasting tool.

        Managers’ Lab is a decision laboratory.

        Here, you test assumptions, constraints, and breakpoints behind everyday managerial choices — pricing, growth, financing, customer value, and cost structure.

        The tools are already built.
        The responsibility for judgment is yours.

        Managers’ Lab does not tell you what to do.
        It shows you what must be true for a decision to work — and what breaks when it doesn’t.
